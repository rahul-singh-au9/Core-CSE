1) What is the CAP theorem? Differentiate between forward proxy and reverse proxy. -

It is a tool used to makes system designers aware of the trade-offs while designing networked shared-data systems.

""The CAP theorem states that it is not possible to guarantee all three of the desirable properties – consistency, availability, and partition tolerance at the same time in a distributed system with data replication.""

The theorem states that networked shared-data systems can only strongly support two of the following three properties:
1.Consistency
2.Availability
3.Partition Tolerant



Forward proxy---
1.Forward proxy can be used by the client to bypass firewall restrictions in order to visit websites that are blocked by school, government, company etc. If a website blocked an IP range from visiting the website, then a person in that IP range can use forward proxy to hide the real IP of the client so that person can visit the website and maybe leave some spam comments.However forward proxy might be detected by the website administrator. There are some paid proxy service that has numerous proxy systems around the world so that they can change your IP address every time your visit a new web page and this makes it harder for website administrators to detect.

Reverse Proxy---
Reverse proxy is mainly used by server admins to achieve load balancing and high availability. A website may have several web servers behind the reverse proxy. The reverse proxy server takes requests from the Internet and forward these requests to one of the web servers. Most visitors don’t know websites are using reverse proxy because they usually lack the knowledge and tools to detect it or they simply don’t care about it. Nginx can be acting both a web server and a reverse proxy at the same time. HAProxy is another well-known open-source reverse proxy software.
