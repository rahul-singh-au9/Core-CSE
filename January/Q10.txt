Normalization:
Normalization is the method used in a database to reduce the data redundancy and data inconsistency from the table. It is the technique in which Non-redundancy and consistency data are stored in the set schema. By using normalization the number of tables is increased instead of decreased.

Denormalization:
Denormalization is also the method which is used in a database. It is used to add the redundancy to execute the query quickly. It is a technique in which data are combined to execute the query quickly. By using denormalization the number of tables is decreased which oppose to the normalization.
