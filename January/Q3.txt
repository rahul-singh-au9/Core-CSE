3) Differentiate between RPC and REST

REST is best described to work with the resources, where as RPC is more about the actions.

REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It is a simple way to organize interactions between independent systems. RESTful applications commonly use HTTP requests to post data (create and/or update), read data (e.g., make queries), and delete data. Thus, REST can use HTTP for all four CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) operations.

RPC is basically used to communicate across the different modules to serve user requests. e.g. In openstack like how nova, glance and neutron work together when booting a virtual machine.
