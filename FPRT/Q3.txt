QUESTION-3. Construct a binary tree by using postorder and inorder sequences given below.
Inorder: N, M, P, O, Q
Postorder: N, P, Q, O,

                               M
                             /   \
                            N     O
                                /  \
                               P    Q


Root node of tree is the last visiting node in Postorder traversal. Thus, Root Node = ‘M’.
The second last node in postorder traversal is O. Thus, node P becomes left child of node O and node Q becomes right child of node Q. Thus, the final tree is:
