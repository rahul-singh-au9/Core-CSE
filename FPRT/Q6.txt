Question 5: Explain Swap Memory
-----------------------------------
A Swap Memory is a space in the Hard Disk of your computer that Operating Systems will use to put the info that is actually on the RAM to free it for another application.

This should be done when the system needs memory for a new process and there is none, so we can see that if our system has plenty of RAM it will maybe need no SWAP memory.

To find out where Swap space (or virtual memory) you can go to Task Manger (CTRL+ALT+DEL) and turn on from VIEW -> COLUMNS -> VIRTUAL MEMORY. Now just calculate the difference between memory usage and virtual memory
