Question 9: What is Context Switching ? Explain in brief.
----------------------------------------------------------

The Context switching is a technique or method used by the operating system to switch a process from one state to another to execute its function using CPUs in the system. When switching perform in the system, it stores the old running process's status in the form of registers and assigns the CPU to a new process to execute its tasks. While a new process is running in the system, the previous process must wait in a ready queue. The execution of the old process starts at that point where another process stopped it. It defines the characteristics of a multitasking operating system in which multiple processes shared the same CPU to perform multiple tasks without the need for additional processors in the system.
